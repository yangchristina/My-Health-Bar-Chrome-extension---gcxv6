### Features: ### 
* A health bar at the bottom of your screen, displaying the amount of screentime you have left. 
* As a user continues to use their device, the health bar slowly depletes and changes colour (green to yellow to red) to indicate the amount of time they have left. 
* Once the user reaches their screen time limit (empty health bar), My Health Bar will display a flashing warning, reminding the user to take a break.

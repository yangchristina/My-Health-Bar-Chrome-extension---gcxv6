Problems have skyrocketed as study after study show that screen time for youth has exploded in the face of the current outbreak. My Health Bar is a simple solution to the online pandemic within a pandemic.

## What is My Health Bar? ##
My Health Bar is a chrome extension created to help users limit their screen time. The extension places a health bar at the bottom of the user's screen which correlates to the amount of screen time the user has left.

### Features: ### 
* A health bar at the bottom of your screen, displaying the amount of screentime you have left. 
* As a user continues to use their device, the health bar slowly depletes and changes colour (green to yellow to red) to indicate the amount of time they have left. 
* Once the user reaches their screen time limit (empty health bar), My Health Bar will display a flashing warning, reminding the user to take a break. 
* Users can also increase their 'health' by taking a walk outside and drinking water.
* clicking on the park icon will redirect you to a new google maps tab of parks near you
